    <h1>"Thick of it"</h1>
    <p>I'm in the thick of it, everybody knows
They know me where it snows, I skied in and they froze
I don't know no nothin' 'bout no ice, I'm just cold
Forty somethin' milli' subs or so, I've been told</p>
<h2></h2>
    <p>I'm in my prime and this ain't even final form
They knocked me down, but still, my feet, they find the floor
I went from living rooms straight out to sold-out tours
Life's a fight, but trust, I'm ready for the war</p>
<h2></h2>
    <p>Woah-oh-oh
This is how the story goes
Woah-oh-oh
I guess this is how the story goes</p>
